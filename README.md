# Abstract
 This is a repository to demo enemy character AI at the 2D shooting game. My 
enemy character AI is implemented by BT(Behavior Tree) which is often used to 
create behaviors of NPC (Non-Playable Character) even in commercial games.
 And then, not only the character AI, I implements entire demo with Processing. 
Processing is a programming environment for visual programming. And, you can very 
easy to test it with Processing.
